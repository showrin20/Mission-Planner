        <h4>Understanding the Map</h4>
        <p>This map shows the potential areas of river erosion in a coastal area of Bangladesh, particularly near Bhola Island. Each marker on the map represents a location that has been randomly assigned a risk and impact level.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> The data shown on this map is randomly generated for demonstration purposes. In the real project, we plan to integrate real-time data from satellite imagery to accurately represent the risk and impact of river erosion in coastal areas of Bangladesh.</p>
        <p>We chose a solution that is based on practicality and efficiency. The project utilizes satellite data to create a color-coded map identifying zones at risk of river erosion for early warning and impact assessment. By processing data from the Sentinel databank, as well as utilizing multispectral imagery and Digital Elevation Models, we plan to analyze riverbank changes, vegetation health, and topographic features. Furthermore, change detection algorithms and vegetation indices shall be used to classify erosion impact zones into high, medium, and low categories. The resulting map will provide a comprehensive view of erosion risks, aiding proactive mitigation and decision-making via Geographic Information tools.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>High Risk & Severe Impact (Red):</strong> These areas are most susceptible to severe river erosion and significant infrastructure damage.</li>
            <li><strong>Medium Risk & Moderate Impact (Orange):</strong> These areas face moderate risk of river erosion with moderate impact on infrastructure.</li>
            <li><strong>Low Risk & Low Impact (Green):</strong> These areas have a lower risk of river erosion with minimal impact on infrastructure.</li>
