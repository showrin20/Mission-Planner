        <h4>Understanding the Map</h4>
        <p>This map shows the potential areas of river erosion in a coastal area of Bangladesh, particularly near Bhola Island. Each marker on the map represents a location that has been randomly assigned a risk and impact level.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> The data shown on this map is randomly generated for demonstration purposes. In the real project, we plan to integrate real-time data from satellite imagery to accurately represent the risk and impact of river erosion in coastal areas of Bangladesh.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>High Risk & Severe Impact (Red):</strong> These areas are most susceptible to severe river erosion and significant infrastructure damage.</li>
            <li><strong>Medium Risk & Moderate Impact (Orange):</strong> These areas face moderate risk of river erosion with moderate impact on infrastructure.</li>
            <li><strong>Low Risk & Low Impact (Green):</strong> These areas have a lower risk of river erosion with minimal impact on infrastructure.</li>
        </ul>
